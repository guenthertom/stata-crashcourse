We will use the publicly available **hs0** data from UCLA for the following exercises. 

<h5>Exercise 1 ‚Äì Ordinary Least Squares </h5>

- Load the dataset **hs0.dta**.
- `regress` *math* on *write*. Interpret the estimated coefficient.
- Add `i.gender` to the model. Interpret the estimated coefficient.
- Add `c.write#i.gender` to the model. Interpret the estimated coefficient.

<summary>üí° Hint</summary>

*math* is your dependent (left-hand side) variable. <br>
The qualifier `c.` tells Stata that a variable is continuous, `i.` is for categorical variables.
By combining variables with `#` you include an interaction between them into the model. <br>

</details>   

<details>
<summary>‚úÖ Solution</summary>

```stata
use "https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/hs0", clear
regress math c.write
```

The coefficient on *write* shows the expected change in *math* scores for a one-point increase in writing. E.g., a 10-point increase in *write* scores is associated with a 6.1-point increase in math scores.

```stata
regress math c.write i.gender
```

The coefficient on *gender* compares females to males at the same *write* score. A negative estimate means that, controlling for writing, females have lower average *math* scores than males.

```stata
regress math c.write i.gender c.write#i.gender
```

The interaction term indicates if the slope of *write* differs by *gender*. For women, the association between *math* and *write* scores is stronger than for men. This difference is not significant.

<h5>Exercise 2 ‚Äì Predictions & residuals </h5>

- Load the dataset **hs0.dta**.
- `regress` *math* on *write* and *gender*.
- `predict` fitted values *math_hat*. 
- `predict` residuals *resid_hat*.
- Plot residuals vs. fitted values.
- Provide a **QQ-plot** for the standardized residuals *resid_hat_std*.

<details>
<summary>üí° Hint</summary>

You may use `predict` to calculate residuals and standardized residuals. <br>
You may also calculate residuals by hand after predicting the fitted values. <br>
Use `scatter` to plot residuals (y-axis) against fitted values (x-axis). <br>
Use `qnorm resid_hat_std` for the QQ-plot.

<h5>Exercise 3 ‚Äì Testing hypotheses </h5>

- Load the dataset **hs0.dta**.
- `regress` *math* on *write* and *gender*.
- `test` if the coefficient on *write* is equal to 1.
- `test` if *write* and *gender* are jointly significant.

Consult the *help* file for `test`. You have to pass the coefficient names to `test`. You can find the names of coefficients in the regression output.

test write 2.gender
```

<h5>Exercise 4 ‚Äì Using `margins` </h5>

- Load the dataset **hs0.dta**.
- `regress` *math* on *write* and *gender*.
- Use `margins i.gender` to compare predicted *math* scores across *gender*.
- Use `predict` to calculate fitted values. `summarize` fitted values `by` *gender*. Compare your results.
- Use `margins, dydx(write)` to interpret marginal effects.

  style="width:100%;
         font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', monospace;
         font-size: 0.95rem;
         padding: 0.6rem;
         border: 1px solid #999;
         border-radius: 6px;
         color: #000;
         background-color: #fff;
         outline: none;
         box-shadow: none;"
  placeholder="Type your solution here. To run code, copy the commands into Stata."></textarea>
  
<details>
<summary>‚úÖ Solution</summary>

```stata
use "https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/hs0", clear
regress math c.write i.gender
margins gender
predict math_hat 
bys gender: sum math_hat
```

Calculated means are different. <br>
`margins gender` reports adjusted means: it predicts *math* for each observation twice (as if male and as if female), holding each observation‚Äôs own *write* value fixed, then averages. So groups are compared with the same distribution of controls. <br>
Using `predict` and `bys gender: summarize` averages fitted values within each group‚Äôs actual covariate distribution, so differences in *write* across groups affect the means.

```stata
margins, dydx(write)
```

For linear models, this is just the estimated coefficient. This will become especially useful when estimating non-linear models, where marginal effects are not equal to coefficients.

<h5>Exercise 5 ‚Äì Non-linear models </h5>

- Load the dataset **hs0.dta**.
- Create a dummy variable *high_math* which equals 1 for observations with a *math* score over 60, and 0 if *math* is 60 or lower.
- Estimate a logistic regression of *high_math* on *write* and *gender*.
- Use `margins, dydx()` to calculate average marginal effects.
- Use `margins, at(write = (40 50 60))` to predict probabilities of scoring high on *math* for different *write* scores.
- Use `marginsplot` to plot predicted probabilities across the empirical distribution of *write* scores.

<textarea id="ex5" rows="18"
  style="width:100%;
         font-family: ui-monospace, SFMono-Regular, Menlo, Consolas, 'Liberation Mono', monospace;
         font-size: 0.95rem;
         padding: 0.6rem;
         border: 1px solid #999;
         border-radius: 6px;
         color: #000;
         background-color: #fff;

<details>
<summary>üí° Hint</summary>

You need to `generate` a new variable. Use a suitable *if*-condition and do not forget to exclude missings. <br>
Use `logit` to estimate a logistic regression. <br>
To span the empirical range of *write*, store `r(min)` and `r(max)` in **locals** after `summarize` and feed these to `margins` with the option `at(write=(local_min(1)local_max))`. <br>
When calling a **local**, enclose its name in backticks and apostrophes: `local'.

</details> 
  
<details>
<summary>‚úÖ Solution</summary>

```stata
use "https://stats.idre.ucla.edu/stat/data/hs0", clear
gen high_math = 1 if math > 60 & !missing(math)
replace high_math = 0 if math <= 60
logit high_math c.write i.gender 
margins, dydx(write gender)
```

The average marginal effect for *write* gives the change in the probability of being above 60 in *math* for a one-point increase in the *write* score, keeping *gender* constant.

```stata
margins, at(write = (40 50 60))
```

The predicted probability (no marginal effects here!) of scoring high on *math* increases in the *write* score. 

```stata
summarize write
local write_min = r(min)
local write_max = r(max)
margins, at(write = (`write_min'(1)`write_max'))
marginsplot
```

<h5>Exercise 6 ‚Äì Quiz </h5>

Answer the following Single-Choice questions (i.e., there is always exactly one correct answer) on **panel data models**. <br>

<span style="display:block; margin-top:0.5em;"></span>

**Q1: Which command tells Stata that the dataset is panel data, and what arguments does it require?** <br>
A) xtreg y x, fe <br>
B) xtset id time <br>
C) tsset id <br>
D) xtdata id time

<details>
<summary>‚úÖ Solution</summary>

**Correct answer: B** <br>
`xtset` needs a panel dimension, i.e., the identifier for units of observation which are sampled more than once. A time dimension is optional. <br>
`xtreg` estimates panel data models after you `xtset` your data.

</details>

<span style="display:block; margin-top:0.5em;"></span>

**Q2: What command is correct for estimating a fixed-effects model?** <br>
A) xtreg y x, fe <br>
B) xtreg y x, re <br>
C) xtreg y x, mle <br>
D) xtreg y x, robust

<details>
<summary>‚úÖ Solution</summary>

**Correct answer: A** <br>
The *option* `re` estimates a *random effects* model. <br>
The *option* `robust` provides robust standard errors.

</details>

<span style="display:block; margin-top:0.5em;"></span>

**Q3: Suppose you have estimated a fixed-effects model with:** <br>

```stata
xtreg wage educ exp, fe
```

Which of the following statements is true? <br>
A) The effect of *educ* is identified only from variation **within** individuals over time.  <br>
B) The effect of *educ* is identified from both **between** and **within** variation.  <br>
C) In fixed effects models, standard errors are automatically cluster robust.  <br>
D) The model cannot identify the effect of *exp* since work experience never changes over time.

<details>
<summary>‚úÖ Solution</summary>

**Correct answer: A** <br>
To estimate cluster robust standard errors, you need to specify the *option* `vce(cluster id)`
