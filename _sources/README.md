# Stata Crash Course

**Introduction into Stata that will enable you to conduct your first data analysis.**

This short course is designed to get you started with Stata, focusing on core skills needed for basic data management and statistical analysis. It includes example `.do` files, slides with short video explanations and exercises.

I developed this course as part of an international teaching collaboration between **Freie Universität Berlin** and the **University of Leeds**. The purpose of this repository is to keep the material accessible to students and independent learners beyond my employment at Freie Universität Berlin.

## 🔍 What You'll Learn

- Basic Stata syntax and command structure
- Navigating Stata's documentation
- Organizing a reproducable workflow
- Data import and manipulation
- Model estimation
- Output presentation
  
## How You'll Learn

The course is divided into nine units. Each unit works with a combination of slides, videos and exercises.

- 📄 Slides serve as the script. You should read them before watching the video.
- ▶️ Videos are hosted on YouTube.
- 🧪 Exercises contain empty space for coding. To get the full hand-on experience, I recommend to do the exercises in Stata though.
