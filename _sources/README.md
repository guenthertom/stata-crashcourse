# Stata Crash Course
*A practical introduction to data analysis with Stata*

**Author: Tom Günther**

---

This crash course will guide you through the basics of Stata, helping you take your first confident steps in data analysis.

I developed this course as part of an international teaching collaboration between **Freie Universität Berlin** and the **University of Leeds**. The purpose of this repository is to keep the material accessible to independent learners beyond my employment at Freie Universität Berlin.

## 🎯 What You'll Learn

- Basic Stata syntax and command structure
- Navigating Stata's documentation
- Organizing a reproducible workflow
- Data import and manipulation
- Model estimation
- Output presentation
  
## 🔍 How You'll Learn

The course is divided into 9 units. Each unit works with a combination of slides, videos and exercises.

- 📄 Slides serve as the script - read them before watching the video.
- ▶️ Videos are hosted on YouTube.
- 🧪 Exercises leave space for coding, but are best done directly in Stata.
