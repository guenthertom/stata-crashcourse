# Overview 

## Structure of the learning material

The course teaches you Stata's basic principles via a combination of videos and slides. They are assigned to different parts: 
- Part 1: Introduction to Stata and building your data set for analysis
- Part 2: Introduction into data analysis with Stata

Videos are not directly embedded here, but hosted on YouTube. By clicking the presented thumbnail, you are directly redirected to the video. If you prefer opening a new tab for the video, right-click on the thmubnail instead.

Afer each part, you may test you knowledge by completing our hand-on exercies. While you can code within the prompts presented by the exercies, we strongly recommand to do the coding directly in Stata to famalirize yourself with its common workflow.
