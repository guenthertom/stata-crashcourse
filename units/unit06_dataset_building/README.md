## 🧪 Exercises: Apply What You’ve Learned

Once you've completed the video, try to solve the following exercises. For your solutions, you may use the provided GitHub prompt or, even better, solve the tasks in your Stata working environment directly.

- Exercises
    - Generate some toy data
    - Append the data
    - Merge the data
        - 1:1 with simple identifier
        - Inspect _merge and question
        - 1:1 with complex identifier
        - You have to drop _merge before this merge!
        - m:1
        - m:1 but this time only keep observations from the master data and do not generate the _merge variable
